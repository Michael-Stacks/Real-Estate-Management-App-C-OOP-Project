🏡 A Real Estate Agency Application built with Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This project is a modular and extensible real estate management application, designed to apply key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. It allows users to manage real estate listings, clients, and transactions while demonstrating advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.

🚀 Features & Concepts Implemented
✔️ Encapsulation & Modular Programming – Organized code with clear separation of concerns.
✔️ Classes & Inheritance – Base and derived classes for different real estate entities.
✔️ Polymorphism – Flexible and reusable class structures.
✔️ Exception Handling – Robust error management for a smooth user experience.
✔️ Templates (Function & Class Templates) – Generic programming for scalability.
✔️ Associations & Aggregation – Real-world relationships between objects.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++
Programming Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Development Style: Modular programming
